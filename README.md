## How to run the code locally?

Follow the following steps to get started with local development:

-   Fork the repo to your account

-   Connect your local repo to the upstream using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/sparshsharma2510/Durbin_Relevel`

## How to contribute?

-   **DO NOT** make and push changes to the main branch!

-   **Always** keep your main/working branch in sync with the main repository `git pull upstream main` on the branch you are working on locally.

-   **Always create a new branch** before making any changes `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`, never ever make any changes directly on the master/main branch.

- Give apt **commit names.**
